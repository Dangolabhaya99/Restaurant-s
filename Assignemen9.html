        <p>Khanal’s Kitchen strives to source local, sustainable and organic when possible. We work hard to source
            premium
            ingredients and we cook everything from scratch with love. We also do our best to pay our employees living
            wages (tips are shared with all employees, including kitchen staff) and to reduce our environmental
            footprint wherever we can. Overall, these factors translate to higher menu prices, but we hope that you find
            value and feel a sense of comfort in knowing that we aim to get better everyday at doing what is important
            to us.</p>
